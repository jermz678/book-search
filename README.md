# book-search

## Here is an app that I was tasked with changing to use Apollo -server - express.
## The idea of the app is to be able to either sign up or log in, and then search for books.  Books can be saved, or deleted from your account.
## It is not working perfectly yet, but I hope you enjoy seeing what has been done so far!

### here is a link to the deployed project!
